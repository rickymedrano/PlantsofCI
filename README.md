# PlantsofCI
CSUCI Software Engineering COMP350 Spring 2018 Project

This is an app made in Android Studio that lets you explore the plants of CSUCI campus. You have 2 options to do this. An interactive map built on Google maps with appropriate GPS markers. The other way is a populated list of plants with a filter option to narrow down by name. Once you select a plant, it will give you details such as whether it's native, growth requirements, species name, campus location and more.
